🏫 Why this project?

Our HODs told us:

> “Creating timetables is the hardest job, especially avoiding conflicts and placing labs.”



So we said… challenge accepted 😎.
This project is specially designed for our Indian college system (CME, ECE, MECH, etc.), with:

6 days/week × 7 periods/day.

Teacher workload limit (28 periods/week).

1st year = lunch after 3 periods, others = lunch after 4 periods.

Multiple sections per branch.
